#Text-Adventure Game!

This is my first project I built using javaScript. The object was to create a text-based interative experience where you can make changes and or choose different options. 

I made a simple game where you have to provide user-input to complete some simple challenges as beating the computer at rock-paper-scissors and translating some sentence to get a passcode to break out of your environment.

 Throughout this project I've learned a lot of basic javaScript such as using comprehensive if and for loops (improved my understanding of JS logic in general), making CSS-changes through JS, using an API - and through that learned more about how cookies work. 
 
 It's been a fun project and I'm excited to use and improve my knowledge creating more projects like this.
